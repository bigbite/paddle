    <h3 id="our-cookie-policy">Our Cookie Policy</h3>
    <p>As part of our overall approach to privacy and transparency, this section describes what cookies are in the context of our web and mobile interfaces, and what their use means to you. At the end, we&#39;ve included some links to help you research cookies and their impact, and how you can use your web browser to control the way it manages cookies.</p>
    <h5>What are cookies?</h5>
    <p>According to Wikipedia:
    &quot;A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user&#39;s web browser while a user is browsing a website. When the user browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the user&#39;s previous activity. [1] Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember the state of the website or activity the user had taken in the past.&quot;
    (used under licence: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a>)</p>
    <h5>What cookies do we use?</h5>
    <p>In this section, we explain what cookies are used in the overall service we provide to our users, and how you can switch off cookies via a setting in your browser.</p>
    <h5>Our use of cookies:</h5>
    <p>We use cookies to record when you&#39;ve logged into our service (either via web or mobile) so you don&#39;t have to keep logging in for each new page; we also use our own cookies to recognise who you are when you return to our platform in a new visit.
    These cookies are an essential part of how our platform operates, and they greatly improve your user experience.  Ironically, the banner that you saw the first time you looked at the website alerting you to the use of cookies makes use of a cookie itself, that would not be required were it not for the European Directive on the use of cookies.
    These cookies are only used by us, and the information they contain is not shared with anyone else.
    List of services we use which use their own cookies:
    Google Analytics
    We use Google Analytics to understand general trends about our content and traffic sources: for example, where users come from, which pages are most popular, which sites provide most traffic, how our marketing efforts impact the amount of visits we receive.
    Google&#39;s statement about privacy is here: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a></p>
    <h5>Consent</h5>
    <p>In line with the latest advice from the Information Commissioner’s Office, we interpret your continued use of our platform as consent for us to use cookies to capture data about how you interact with our services, and those of other services we use.</p>
